every woman needs a pair of these frye boots ! fit is true to normal size . i wear a standard 9 . these fit in the shaft for any ladies who have bigger calves as i do . you have to fight to get them on first few times and they wear stiff until fully broken in . worth the money and break in time .
i bought these in navy to wear in my sisters wedding . they matched my navy satin dress perfectly and were super comfortable . i wore these shoes longer than i have worn any heels . the lower heel gave me just enough height , but not to much to make me unsteady . looking forward to wearing them again and again !
this pendant is so unique ! ! the design is beautiful and the bail is a ring instead of the typical bail which gives it a nice touch ! ! all the corners are smooth and my daughter loves it - looks great on her.i can not say anything about the chain because used our own chain . : ) satisfied .
the only reason for the 1-star reduction , is the seams around the legs are pretty stiff and tight . however , the seams appear to be loosening up a bit though with use . i typically wear a size 32 but had to get a 34 for this suit .
i would recommend these shoes to anyone looking for a very comfortable walking shoe with some style . i can wear these instead of sneakers for less casual events . the shoes run big . i normally wear a 7 1 / 2 , but ended up with the 7 which fit just right .
i have several pairs of dansko clogs that are all size 39 and fit perfectly . so i felt confident when i ordered the tasha sandal in size 39 . i do n't know if a 40 would be too large but the 39 seems a little small . otherwise , i love them . they are very cushiony and comfortable !
as other people mentioned the liner in these are super small . i took them on vacation to hawaii and on the second day i cut out the bottom of the liner . the waist fits fine but the liner inside is not sized accordingly . i just cut the liner at the bottom so i could be comfortable and all was well after that .
i overpronate and should have known better than to buy these shoes . they are really sharp looking and probably would work for someone with a regular feet . i wish i could have kept them as i did get lots of compliments at the gym when wearing them ; )
after receiving this dvd + r , i think i should order the 50 piece spindle . i did not burn too often . i believe it is enough for 2 years . i tried a couple of discs , anyway , like it .
i recently bought this film and slide scanner to scan my grandfather 's slide collection . it bleaches out the image with too much light . i tried changing the settings to improve the image quality , but had no luck . the company arcsoft charges $ 10.00 per phone call for tech support . you are better off making the investment on a nicer quality scanner .
we use it in our office to tell another employee if they have a call on hold , but that is about all it is good for . do n't bother trying to have a conversation , clarity is too poor . i did n't realize until after the fact that i should have just bought walkie talkies . at least battery life in these are good .
i ordered this for my acer 5532 . it heats up right away and i only use it to charge the laptop , it is n't plugged in for very long . after only 2 weeks it melted ! this is horrible and dangerous !
first problem i have with this receiver is you ca n't set the channel presets . also the speaker wire terminals are not clamps and it took me a while to screw them in . the power is good and it looks durable . i do n't believe you can play the tv 's sound through the receiver .
i use this with a dual-camera mount and i like this because of the heft / weight and it stays pretty secure whether i use it with the mount or on my flip video camera or snapshot . i 'd recommend this handle highly .
i bought this camera based on consumer reports review . it has met most of the requierments . its picture quality is better than the cannon 110 hs that it is replacing . i had to glue a riser on the on / off button since it was too small for my thumb
the sound of the radio is of real quality . i also like having the two separate alarms and the alarm is not obnoxious yet still wakes us up . my wife charges her iphone on it regularly and works out well . we like the sony so much i got one for my son and his wife for a christmas present
i have been using this product for over 10 years . it works much better than common over the counter deodorants and lasts much longer . i have never had a odor issue using this product no matter how hot or sweaty i got . great stuff ... the larger 5 oz purchase is the most economical.highly recomend .
we have a full-size analog model of the marpac sleep mate sound conditioner , and have used it for years at home , but it 's too bulky to pack . this model is compact , and sounds pretty much like the original . there is no repeating 'loop ' of sound to drive you crazy .
this was very well-rated on consumer reports . i really like that you can plug in your target heart rate , and it has an audible alert to let you know when you 're there . the display is easy to read and it 's light-weight .
woohoo what a great product . a few sprays and the wrinkles disappear from your teeshirts and dress shirts . it has a little trouble with clothing like dress pants and also it did n't work on removing wrinkles from my curtains . that said , this baby has saved me hours of ironing , and i 'm super happy with this purchase .
great product ! very strong magnet that works in holding and keeping your glasses secure . well worth the price that i paid for it ... first showing of this product was on 'shark tank ' and it has lived up to expectations !
these insoles are so thin that i can even wear them in my pumps . they look so much nicer than odor-eaters and work way better too . i highly recommend them . i accidentally ordered a men 's 9 instead of a women 's 9 . it was huge but very easy to trim down with scissors . enjoy !
i think zippo over charges and i wanted to try off brand . i must say i have been pleasantly surprised and my wallet thanks me . do n't get me wrong i love classic zippo lighters however butane torches are clean burning and are great for edc since they have almost zero odor . the torch also adjusts very nicely so you can fine tune your preference .
i purchased this to put in my soylent mix , and i could n't be happier . like other supplements i 've ordered from this company , the product is well shipped and the resealable bag is easy to store . i also like how concentrated it is , and how little i need to use to supplement my diet.could n't be happier .
i love this steamer . everyone in my family now has one because they are so great . it is easy to use and easy to clean . i love using it to make rice - no more cleaning up boiled-over rice from the stove ! it also makes corn on the cob and boiled eggs hassle free .
this is the wrong filter if you are buying the chv1510 hand vacuum . amazon pairs it up together and it says it works with all 'cyclonic hand vacs , ' but it does n't . you need the vf110 for the chv1510 . amazon wrong . product description wrong . me wrong for not reading the reviews first .
this poster is a few years out of date - still lists pluto as a planet - but man , the artwork on it is awesome . i also love the inset map that shows the planets ' sizes to scale . it 's probably not good for a classroom due to its age , but for a bedroom or general decoration , it 's great .
the table and chairs are very nice but not quite the color i expected ( but i am getting used to it ) . table and chairs delivered by the carrier right on time and with no damage . very easy to assemble , but very difficult to get out of the box it was so well protected .
this teapot works well for me , sometimes i wish it had a whistle . the color appears as shown . remember to use it on low / medium heat . at first the top is a little difficult to remove but now it works well .
great machine ! ! ! i use it 3-4 times a week and perfect tortillas every time . i also make pizza crusts , pancakes and crepes . you have to get the recipe and technique right for tortillas but once you do it is easy . love having a freezer full of bean burritos for a quick lunch .
this fan is a horrible purchase . it does n't blow air straight ahead . you have to turn the fan at an angle to feel any wind and only if on high and within 24 inches . it was such a waste of money , i now have to buy another fan .
i love this steamer and am purchasing a second one ! it 's a great size for a single person to steam veggies or even microwave fish , and the silicone makes it so easy to clean and store . the apple green color is cheerful and i love i can eat from the container ( i hate doing dishes lol ) .
