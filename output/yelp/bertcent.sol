my go - to quick car wash ! i pass 2 other similarly priced washes to get here and its worth it ! for starters they hand out candy at the register ! the car wash itself does a great job , especially compared to any nearby quick wash places , and of course the vacuums are free . once dropped my wallet here , was still there 2 days later with all its contents . awesome friendly staff ! this should be your go to spot !
victoria is my favorite :) she fixed a situation with the other nail tech because she wasn ' t filing my nails properly - she did my pedi great though . anyways i used to go to polished nails and pay too much just because they had a lot of gel color selections i like . but now that i ' ve found lovely nails they have all the same beautiful unique colors and it ' s reasonably priced ! not to mention i don ' t really need to make an appointment and the management here solves issues better . my new fav nail place . been in vegas 11 years and i ' ve tried many places . this one is great :)
patio seating is great . waiters are awesome . food is middle of the road . it ' s a good place to go with it being close to my family ' s home . fiesta platter is huge and great for two to share . specials are a good value and plenty of food if you aren ' t picky . it ' s the go - to place for sit down mexican when we are in town .
 greatest dive bar ever ! their christmas decorations rival that of coach house but without the scottsdale crowd . you can find every type of person hanging out here . the staff is friendly and they pour heavy ( but not too heavy ). my friend said to me a few months ago , " i found the greatest dive bar ever you have to go to called the swizzle inn !" i replied , " it is the greatest ! i ' ve been going to the swizz for years ." maybe i should have shared the info sooner ? 
 delicious food , good service , and just off the beaten path . loved this place . the tacos are authentic and well priced . my favorite tacos are in tijuana , especially their octopus tacos ( they ' re amazing , highly recommended you add it to your bucket list ). it was a little slower and i noticed octopus as an option on the menu . i asked if the chef could make some octopus tacos special . he said he could and they were exactly as i wanted . so good ! can ' t wait to go back . 
 the greater cleveland aquarium is a nice place to spend a couple of hours in the downtown cleveland / flats area . it is expensive , in my opinion for what is actually there . it is family friendly , and children enjoy it . the building is really cool - and sharks are always fascinating , you can touch a ray , have fish , sharks and rays swim over your head in the tunnels , and also feed the rays - but be mindful of feeding times . costumed staff / tour guides add to the charm factor . the gift shop has a nice assortment of souvenirs . 
this was my first time getting an annual exam in over 20 years ( i know , i know ) the doctor and staff made me feel very comfortable and at ease . dr . benitez explained in detail so that i understood what was going on and all the steps we were going to take for my care . i am extremely glad i was referred here and will be going for regular visits now . thank you , nicole
we walked in through here to get to cafe sienna . the exterior of the building is quite nice and this place is pretty big . as soon as you enter the smell of cigarette smoke and the sound of the slot machines hits you .. . ting ting ting ting .. you know you are in vegas ! they are open 24 / 7 - gambling and food ! the crowd here was much older , enjoying drinks , meals and gambling . this wouldn ' t be my kinda casino to stay it but decent enough .
best shawarma around ! 1 . totally worth your money . 2 . the owner gives pride on his work . 3 . full filling ( costco size ) 4 . combos are great ( any choice in meat ) frie / salad and a pop . everything about this place is amazing . totally recommend it to all my friends and family and no one is ever disappointed . best shawarma i have ever had in the gta
i would usually never write a review on a macy ' s but i felt compelled to do so because this is far and away the best macy ' s i have ever visited . trust i have been to tons ! the salespeople there were so friendly and helpful ! they had an amazing selection . the shoe section was out of control busy but the salespeople were working their butts off to be helpful to people . i will go back here next time for sure !
i got the pesto lasagna and i personally loved the kale cesar even more next time i will get the kale cesar all for myself ! the staff are the sweetest and the ambiance is adorable casual chic good for every occasional what a nice place !! i will definitely go back !
we play trivia here on tuesdays quite often . decent for that , but the food is pretty consistent as well . very good buffalo burger and tacos on taco night . they usually have a deal going for every week day . fairly decent value and pretty good staff . i know this sounds like a 3 star review , but for what this place is i have to give them the round up . you will not be disappointed if you are looking for a sports bar with good service and value .
i ordered the redondo burrito like so many other yelpers and it was fantastic . i was watching them make the burritos and they put so much in them that even though it comes out small it is very hearty meal . i also ordered a side of miso soup which had huge chunks of tofu in it . the staff was extremely friendly and my food came out fast . the price was very reasonable and there was a lot of seating both indoors and outdoors . can ' t wait to go back !
these guys are amazing . we needed to move quickly when i was unexpectedly put on bedrest at 6 months pregnant . my husband and i moved here about a year before and didn ' t have friends and family to help out . i purchased a groupon for taurus moving hoping to make the process simpler and could not have been happier with the result . david clearly communicated the process , any additional expenses and even tips to reduce the likelihood of overages . day of the move , they were on time , friendly and definitely hustled to get the job done as quickly as possible . i would recommend to anyone in need of moving services !
holy pizza ! if you ' re not visiting chicago anytime soon then this pizza joint is a must ! hands down best deep dish pizza i ' ve had in the gta . the crust is cooked well and the right amount of sauce , cheese and toppings is used . i love the garlic sauce drizzle on top ! if your heading to mickeys just make sure you call ahead of time to place an order , or else they might be sold out ! 
nice small family owned cafe close to nothing bundt cakes . we ordered the gyro and chicken pita which each were $ 5 . both were very good and tasty . just enough mayo on the gyro where it complimented the taste rather than took over . this is a small cafe with around 15 tables and you walk in to a aisle leading to the counter to order your food . i liked this place and for $ 5 how can you beat the price and this is a great alternative for burgers or pizza . will definitely be back again and try other items from the menu .
 not sure why , but i ' ve always viewed this establishment as the next option if teroni ' s was too busy . however , having tried it for the first time last week , mercatto ' s is certainly a worthy first option if your looking for casual italian food . service was excellent , decor was beautiful and a great selection of dishes on the menu , something for everyone . must try the iced cuppiccino , could be the be the best in the city . 
 awesome sandwiches best bread , had the pastrami sandwich and it was a great experience with the homemade bread , pastrami meat and the condiments included , would not change a thing . did i mention the bread ? it is toasted and has a great taste and firm consistency . the restaurant is an older quaint building which is nice and fun . better one of the best sandwiches in town . 
amazing food and great service ! the hospitality was out of this world . will definitely be back soon . the wait was less than 5 minutes at 7pm on a friday night , amazing !! the staff was very kind and the waitresses were very attentive and helpful . we tried the frog legs , catfish , alligator bites , crab legs , gumbo and of course the hush puppies ! everything was outstanding . what a hidden gem !
 you need to come here for the food alone . it is so amazing ! we ordered pizza , pasta , and salad and everything was perfect . the pizza was better than the ones i had in new york !!! it ' s a nice little family owned restaurant and the outside seating is beautiful . i would definitely recommend this place . amazing food !! 
this was by far the best experience my husband and i have ever had . we shopped around for months . we called and spoke with adam over the phone and negotiated the trade - in / new car pricing . we drove three hours away to work with this dealership . everything we discussed over the phone and text was exactly the same when we came into the dealership . when we arrived to the dealership , we dealt with rick melara and he was beyond helpful and very pleasant to work with . these guys were knowledgable , friendly and most importantly ... honest !! they have our future business ! 
came on a saturday night at 830 . all apps for a group of four were forgotten . i expressed my love of spicy food to our server and i am an adventurous eater . he recommended lamb masala . it was very bland even with eating all red peppers included . never offered a refill on our beers or cocktails . lousy experience and will be looking elsewhere for indian .
nom nom nom nom nom . my mouth is watering . i think i ' m due for a review too after eating here like everyday in november after discovering . my mom visited in march and we thought about going here but were sketchy about the cash only policy . i have seriously missed out since then because i love this place . the first time i came here my mom and i shared the beef noodle soup and the won ton soup . both were so amazing with lots of fresh cilantro and green onion ! it ' s def not a fancy place but this place has super great and flexible hours . i think they are open until 2am on friday / saturday . this is the perfect place to go on a chilly vegas night !
 hachi ramen is delicious ! it is just like being at a small ramen shop in japan . they focus on their broths creating complex and amazing flavors . i have tried two of the ramen flavors , their small plates and desserts and have been floored each time . this is the best ramen in the state and i highly recommend it . 
stayed here for one evening . check in was smooth and easy ! ben was awesome and very welcoming . he shows interest in each customer he is dealing with ! first time visiting arizona and he had good advice on the area . the hotel was pretty clean only problem was the outside light never tired off later in the evening so it felt like we had a night light . very refreshing pool . would return again !
 this place is a pastry heaven when you walk in . the eclairs , macarons , cakes are absolutely gorgeous looking . i ' ve had the eclairs and macarons . eclairs are very good !! the shoe pastry is stuffed full !! i tried their mango passionfruit and it was yum ! macarons were perfect and a bit cheaper than nadege so i ' m definitely going back . these pastries make excellent presentable little gifts for family and friends :) 
 i went on a balloon ride with hot air expeditions for my birthday and it was an absolutely amazing experience . i really appreciate the staff for being so friendly and helpful . i flew to az from chicago for the experience and it was well worth it . walter was my pilot and he was great . he had a lot of knowledge of the area and explained the history of what we were flying over and seeing , as well as provided recommendations for other things to do when we landed . the crew provided breakfast and a birthday cake for us which was really sweet . i have nothing bad to say about this i recommend hot air expeditions over the competitors .
 another awesome meal at blue sushi ; went to celebrate my daughter ' s university acceptance . i don ' t even look at the menu anymore . i just talk with the staff and let them choose . we splurged on the super fresh bluefin toro that was spectacular , the special rolls for the day included a king and i roll that had a spicy thai finish ; super yummy . this is now our goto sushi joint . 
 nice ambiance , the drink menu is brought to you on an ipad ... cool . loved the mirror that allows diners to see directly into the kitchen , foodies dream . i had the petite filet and the truffled mac and cheese with the rioja wine yum . the new york cheesecake was sooo good ! service was excellent as for morbina she was awesome . it is a bit on the pricey side . 
 oh my glob . this is the burger of toronto . it ' s delicious and juicy and fresh , the fries are great , the staff are friendly and don ' t try to upsell you . they just recommend the house favourite , the basic " holy chuck " burger , because it is just de - lish . we went today for the boyfriends birthday , and he got the holy chuck . i wanted to try something new and got the misunderstood breed . while it was good and interesting , i still recommend the holy chuck more . the bacon patty overpowered the freshness of the beef patty so it wasn ' t as enjoyable . 
walked into this place and was greeted with a smile . the owner was very friendly . i ordered a spicy chicken sandwich and was not disappointed . the bread was fluffy and fresh and the sandwich was loaded with chicken . i will definitely be coming back here to try the filet mignon sandwich as well . for $ 6 . 50 the sandwich is a great deal . the combination of freshly grilled meat with fresh veggies make this sandwich mouth watering . i can ' t wait to get my next sandwich .
 initially went to chinatown to eat beef brisket noodle soup at kings noodle but they were closed on wednesdays . walked down dundas and found this spot , decided to try it and as really surprised . the noodles were tasted good , much more generous portions compared to kings noodle and they were the same price . would recommend this place ! 
nandos is a nice place to go for a meal . the service was excellent . the portions were large . the fajitas my wife had were excellent . the mexican pizza was very good . the chips and salsa were great . my meal was good not great . the rice was very average . the cheese on my meal was more of a colby jack as opposed to a nice white mexican cheese . the atmosphere was very pleasant and the place was hopping on a friday night . i would go back .
a regular here for drinks and small bites . it ' s always packed here so it has great energy . the food is pretty good including the calamari and the meat ball app . the burgers are also very good !
what a find ! can ' t think of anything to improve about this place . the decor is festive , the service is friendly and very attentive , but best of all is the food . the food is fantastic ! this is our third visit and the food continues to amaze . the best mexican food we have had . all this located in a small strip mall located on carefree highway just off of i - 17 . i can ' t recommend this place enough .
if you love the desserts in studio b buffet in the m hotel but don ' t want to wait in the massive buffet line or even eat in the buffet , baby cakes in the m hotel is really nice fix . with their yummy gelatos and mini cakes , one must have a really good reason not to step into this place . mini desserts for $ 1 . 50 really cannot be beat ! well , actually , the only good reason that i can think of is that you are eating at studio b buffet . but other than that , there isn ' t one good reason for me to not visit this fabulous establishment for a bit of sweetness if you are in m hotel anyways . no excuses ! yum !
the best chefs in the world have their restaurants here , so do the best artists also come perform in vegas . if that ' s not enough , most casinos have great accommodations , with fantastic pools . yes , and you can smoke , drink , eat foie - gras , shoot exotic guns , skydive , get a massage , do a little gambling , and dance the night away ! las vegas is the playground for adults . if you fancy haute cuisine , put in some effort and dress the part , and you will get the best table . vegas favors the best dressed people in town ! 
 read about the sunday brunch on chow bella and decided to give it a try . was very impressed . the food was delicious ! the french toast was out of this world , and the omelet was perfectly prepared . we will definitely be back .
i was selling some jewelry i called this place of business and the owner was extremely polite and very helpful and generous with his knowledge i then arrived ... he appraise my jewelry and gave me some tips as to how to sell it if i didn ' t want to sell it to him .... this was a pleasant experience for someone in the vulnerable position of selling jewels .. i would definitely shop here again and refer any friends and family to this business ...
 good mexican food in toronto ? at cocina economica , the answer is an enthusiastic yes . i pretty much had their entire menu , and all the dishes were quite good . all the meats are served with rice , beans , corn tortillas and homemade ( spicy ) salsas . the stand out dish for me was the carnitas - falling off the bone . i really enjoyed the vibe of this place . 
 well was very disappointed to see out favorite ice cream parlor closed but delightfully surprised at how much we like this spot !! service was fantastic top notch !! taco was great lots of cheese . freshly deep fried shell not like so many phoenix mex restaurants use ! enchilada was very good . my wife really enjoyed her chimichanga . my moms chilli reanno was great too . everything we had so far was great . we will return . highly recommended . 
 what a great place ! it ' s inside of a quonset hut in gilbert . their beer is phenomenal . the k - lax is a fruity ipa without too much bitter . my favorite was the sunday morning saison . it ' s super smooth and well , just lovely . the vibe is super fun and you can eat phenomenal food from fire and brimstone next door or bring in outside food . super chill and awesome beer . we will be back ! 
winterlicious indeed ! food portions were right and did i already say the food was yummy ! i also enjoyed the atmosphere !
i went to jason ' s on saturday night for the first time . i ended up with a side salad and a baked potato . i didn ' t think you could have a baked potato that big ! the potato was huge and could have been a meal by itself . large selection of items to choose from . i wish there was a few more vegtables at the salad bar and had more crouton options . i will have to head back to try the sandwiches . 
hands down my best haircuts and colors have been by the amazzzzing amanda fuller . she takes her time to understand exactly what i want and even though i ' m terrible at explaining ... she reads my mind and gets it right every time ! i ' ve since moved to san diego but can ' t wait to come back to vegas and get my locks rocked by amanda !
so i was suggest to try this place out by my sister the other day and finally had time to make it over for lunch i wasn ' t too hungry so i just got a couple appetizers . got the chicken salad and a takoyaki . both were really good . the service was good and the place was clean and the music was good . i ' ll be back again to try a ramen sometime soon ! i ' ll leave an update when i do 
amanda or waitress was wonderful ! she explained all the options and specials with flare and was super helpful with substituting some of the options bc my fiance is a vegetarian . this was a wonderful 1st experience at the melting pot !
 this place is a must - do in scottsdale ! we are locals from tempe and came to try their food and pasties . our expectations were surpassed with a delicious sausage roll , chicken avocado pie , and others ! the lamington dessert and apple turnover were perfectly made and i ate the rest of it ! the owner is so cordial and the staff was just as good . the owner came over to our table and put a small town home feel . we will definitely be coming back !
atmosphere and decore is fantastic . lychee martini is five star and at 12 $ it ' s not supernovae priced . the beans are a must order the kimbucha soup was good the mushroom salad was below average as well as our tofu rice noodle large dish , especially for 18 $. i believe that there are better restaurants at red rock .
 being from the east coast , i always worry about getting fish in the midwest but i am going to hand it to sakanaya , the chirashi i had was absolutely delicious . the fish was wonderful , fresh even and with good variety of fishes . i loved the decor and the ambiance , very relaxing . the portions are good , though if you ' re on a budget this might not be the place for you . definitely worth getting again . 
very cool atmosphere although it was extremely crowded for a tuesday morning ... hate to see what saturday looks like . got the thai protein bowl . had overall really good flavor and the forbidden rice was delicious ! also got the slim juice and it too was delicious !
 michael , chris & mr . schumacher himself are so kind and hospitable . when right honda screwed me over royally , the good guys at schumacher walked me through the steps of reversing a car sale they made with me to ensure i didn ' t get manipulated any further . lou is the greatest salesman . no pressure and concerned with the needs of the customer . tracy at the starbucks coffee shop keeps you pleasurable company while you wait and most of the products if her shop are complimentary ! this dealership emits such a warm environment .
this location is minutes from our house . unfortunately , the donuts here are always so dry ! not really stale , but dry donuts . it ' s sad that i can get better and cheaper donuts at smith ' s or vons . the staff working the counter were extremely friendly ! only reason why i ' m giving 3 stars . i keep hearing in general the donuts at dunkin ' are not that good . maybe they should change the recipe . i will not be back .
 solid ramen . nice portion size . a busy , cozy restaurant . the ramen was delicious , as were the cocktails . also , the rice balls , which my companion ordered , and i ' d never had - umami heaven . really tasty . inexpensive , tasty and lively - in montreal ' s somewhat small chinatown . worth a visit if you are craving ramen , and i was .! 
this is a tattoo spot located on the way south end of the strip in what feels like a nearly abandoned strip mall . i walked in without an appointment was able to have an artist work on my tattoo right away . note : appointments are best . the front desk staff were less than friendly . but the artists are great ! the studio is clean and comfy . definitely one of the better places i ' ve been to . i ' m very pleased with my tattoo and will be coming back for more work .
normally this place is awesome , occasionally packed but worth the wait . today not so great ! not just out of one thing today but 4 ! they didn ' t have chicken noodle soup , macaroni and cheese , onion soup or green tea . then they said onion soup isn ' t a sunday soup , even though it ' s on the menu online for sunday . after i paid i realized they were out of tea , and the kid said oh yes we ' re waiting for a shipment . be out one thing ok fine but 4 things is ridiculous . some one did horrible job when ordering this week ! i should have asked for a refund and went to zuppas ! definitely disappointed in today ' s trip to panera !
 i usually hate outlet malls but this one isn ' t too bad . i wanted to do some shopping but didn ' t want to venture all the way into the valley . i found a few great deals to my surprise ! i stopped at the carter ' s baby clothes store , under armor , vitamin world and lastly gap . i will definitely be back . i had an enjoyable experience . 
we have been searching high and low for a good mexican restaurant and we finally found haciendas and it blows everywhere else out of the water !! exceptional customer service and amazing homemade authentic mexican food ! i highly recommend the tacos el pastor along with the tableside guacamole and posole soup ! it is our new favorite restaurant ! i highly recommend it !
great chinese for a fast easy fix . i ' ve been going here for years ! orange chicken is my families favorite ! the pork egg foo young has a ton of vegetables and is worth your dollar . the staff is friendly and the location is clean . only down side was the bathroom door doesn ' t shut it seems to be jammed .
in search for a different non chain place to eat for lunch today , i found this new gem ! it is well located just south of the 1 - 10 . the restaurant is clean and the servers were very friendly . i ordered the vegetable and tofu jasmine rice dish . the sauce was very well seasoned and the tofu had great flavor . there were a few too many onions but overall the flavor was great ! the shrimp spring rolls are good but the peanut could use some more flavor . the prices are very reasonable . most dishes are ~$ 6 . 99 . overall great experience so my husband and i will be back to try out ore dishes on the menu .
my dad took me to this steakhouse for my birthday . it was one of the best meals i have ever eaten , thought it was pretty expensive . i am a big fan of seafood , seafood tower and lobster chowder was a hit . for the main course , i got the porterhouse steak and a side of lobster mashed potatoes . and my dad ordered filet mignon . it was all very delicious , but 250 $ later . i wish it a bit cheaper , so i could come here more often . thank for great meal !
 first time trying this place ... it ' s clean , the service was really good , and the menu was typical . i ordered the chicken lo mein and combination fried rice . the food was full of flavor , and i ' m glad i have a new option when i want chinese . check it out people . 
awesome place . got a 90 min massage from jose . he is amazing , definitely planning on going back for other services . the view of that lake is so pretty , check it out after your down .
the cupcakery left me feeling a little lacklustery ! i had the lemon and orange cupcakes . they were tasty but just okay for me . the decorations were almost non existent on all of the cupcakes . for the price and hoop la about this place you just expect more . 
feels like a traditional italian restaurant . greet decor and wonderful feel inside . service was good but server was new and seemed a little nervous and it was understandable since we were a party of 10 . food was great . i had stuffed manicotti and would get it again !!
 i love how clean and straight forward this place is ! they have a lot of the authentic loose tea options along with their signature milk teas and smoothies . the service was friendly and fast . i also love that they have a soy milk option . it changes everything for me since i ' m lactose - intolerant . i ordered the small thai iced tea with soy milk and it tasted delicious . the tapioca pearls were soft and chewy . prices were fair . i will come back here for future boba tea purchases ! 
this place rocks ! i found a quote to replace my windshield from their website and when i called the manager , chris , said they would do it for less and have me out the door in less than an hour . i waited less than 20 minutes and my windshield was finished . these guys are awesome ! best deal in town with the best customer service !
the food and service were very good . as is typical with vegas , when you get a bottle of wine they are pouring it at the speed of light so your table drinks faster and they ask you if you want another . why not but actually we ' d like to taste it . i had the seabass wrapped in a thin bacon , very good .. the make your own salad with up to ten items was great . everybody loved the food , the orin swift prisoner by the bottle was fabulous ( red blend from napa ), and the service was very good . we closed things out with a tequila shot to get things moving along . will go back . 
( 4 . 5 ) dope place with awesome tea and delicious cookies . the menu may be simple but the food is all great . even the bread is delicious ! everything tastes extremely fresh . it ' s like the chef just bought everything the same day . the service is great and courteous . if you get the mint tea the server will give it to you the moroccan way !
there is a reason this place has such good reviews ( in my opinion it deserves 5 stars ). every time i have gone , the owner always gives me a couple of donut holes , free of charge . i don ' t eat donuts often , but when i ' m in the mood for one i ' m fortunate enough to live just down the street from this place . everyone in the mesa area should come here at least once . their coconut cream filled donuts are to die for . their smoothies are amazing too . if i could write a million 5 - star reviews for them , i absolutely would .
 had the extra pale ale and loved it . in fact i loved everything about this place . the vibe was ideal for a long night of serious causal drinking . from the peanuts on the table to the friendly bartenders , this place just felt homey as soon as you sat on a stool . but unlike other dive this bar has delicious beer and an a chill atmosphere that really makes the beer go down quick and easy . i am looking forward to visiting again ! 
 a few days ago i received my approval letter and based on reviews i knew exactly knew where to go . che and brian exceeded my expectations ! che was very friendly and welcoming . and brian was very patient with me . i had no idea what i was going to get and he really helped me pick some flowers that definitely helped me get medicated the way i wanted to . and i was shocked about the prices ! and they always have specials ! and the staff treated me like a friend , not just a customer . i ' ll definitely be back again !
we ordered peking duck , spicy lobster fried rice and chinese broccoli . i think only in vegas you can spend 150 . 00 on three dishes for chinese food . okay enough about the price , overall i enjoyed my experience here at blossom . the staff were really attentive and i like all the high end decor . definitely not your typical chinese take out . would i be coming back the next time i stay at aria ??, the answer would definitely be yes !!!
great service . super nice staff . i shattered my iphone 5 screen . they had it fixed within 2 hours of me dropping it off . looks better than new . they guaranteed everything be fixed and working normally . absolutely recommend them . would go back for any issue i had with my electronics !
i appreciate seeing new healthy options in my city . it ' s just sad to see that they aren ' t all great as they seem to be . a healthier approach should be tasty ! i ordered the mexicana which tasted like canned salsa on top ; sweet potato fries which tasted like they were microwaved after being frozen ($ 3 . 99 ); and a side of guac $ 1 . 99 for 2 oz it got me by from hunger but i would not be coming back .
 who would have thought that december would be a good time to have lunch on the patio at dean and deluca ? that is what i did today and it was divine . i love coming here to build my own salad . i had the pear vinaigrette dressing and i could have sucked that up through a straw . even though it is a little pricey , the options for the salad bar and sandwich bar and sides are the best . it ' s also a fabulous place to pick up a bottle of wine or some spices or other kitchen items . the atmosphere here is trendy and there is usually a good number of patrons dining and shopping . definitely a winner in charlotte . 
if i could give zero stars , i would . service is awful awful awful awful . 45 min for chicken nuggets and fries . don ' t know their beers and whether they have it available or not ... al pastor tastes like beef and nothing like the menu states . get some more intelligent people to run your restaurant if you want to survive .
this was a fun place to eat , you can build your own bowl ( like a typical mongolian restaurant ) and they have an unlimited option for $ 4 more which is great for trying different creations . one thing i really liked was the " starch " options . they offer noodles and rice , but also offer things like tortillas which adds a whole new element . very reasonably priced .
this is a nice little cozy restaurant for an off work weekday lunch , lazy weekend lunch , or regular evening takeout . it is open 7 days a week , for lunch and dinner , but the above mentioned times are when i usually come to eat . the place sits about 25 people , so if you have a big group , you might not want to consider this place . the lunch specials are pretty good and the fish are pretty fresh too . for the price you are paying , you are getting a very good value in quality and portion .
 this place is awesome ! i am in love with the twitch coffee bean they offer . the coffee is smooth , no bitterness and styled to perfection . the service is great , they pour your latte / cappuccino personally for you . there ' s a starbucks on every corner , it ' s nothing special , but there ' s only one press ! i would drive across town for my press .... and i have !! hey when ya got a hankering for a twitch , ya gotta go !!! 
the ambiance is relaxing , yet refined . the service is always good . the steak was good , although not cooked to the correct temperature which is surprising for a steakhouse . i would recommend ordering for a lesser cook than what you normally order . i typically order medium , but at donovan ' s would get medium rare . the side dish menu was somewhat limited , but we chose the creamed spinach and asparagus , both were good . of course , you have to try the creme brulee - yum ! 
 this place was one of those make your own pizza places . the whole process from ordering , choosing toppings , and receiving the baked end result was quite a breeze . i loved that they had eggs as one of their topping options . taste is quite good for my palette , though i kinda wished that the crust was a bit crispier and had more charcoal texture . overall , it ' s a good place to grab a quick bite of good pizza !
 i ' m so happy to have tried barrelhouse ! stopped there for lunch today and had the harvest salad ( beets , blue cheese , candied pecans , jicama , and field greens ) and split the chocolate pot de creme with a friend . heaven !! the restaurant is beautifully decorated inside and it was easy to forget we were in a strip mall in chandler . this is my new favorite place . 
we started with the arugula salad . which i found to be very good . the price is high but what do you expect in vegas ? the food was good but it is a lot to be spending on food that wasn ' t anything spectacular .. lasagna was okay the salmon was much better !!
customer service is always more important than the food quality , that ' s why i give it 1 star . i was in the drive thru , had asked the worker to take ice out of my coffee ( there was more ice than coffee ) and she walked back and came back with the same amount of ice . i guess she thought i was stupid and that i wouldn ' t notice . so i sent her back to take out more . do the job right the first time and you won ' t have to do it twice . i guess she didn ' t think i would notice that she didn ' t even take out any ice .
i ' m really glad there is a local restaurant near us ! the decor of the space is very beautiful and clean . there is a full bar and a very nice wine list . affordable and realistic pricing . they have a well rounded food menu of traditional italian dishes . we ' ll definitely be back ! i only gave three stars because the server was rough around he edges . i ' ll assume that it is because it is a new restaurant and they are just getting on their feet . excited to go back and try again !
i am so happy with my new eyelashes ! alesha did an amazing job . she is a perfectionist ! i have been there two times now - the second time for the fills and both times was a great experience . i won ' t go anywhere else !
good hickory cheeseburger and good service peter was a super friendly server . he made lots of conversation about jeeps and was very amiable . i had the hickory cheeseburger cooked medium well and it good . good mashed potatoes side and the appetizer buns are great ! all in all i ' m not sure why this place averages 3 stars ... it ' s not a 5 , but definitely with a
do they play country music most of the time ? yes . do they have a mechanical bull ? yes . do they have two - step dancing ? yes . but are they a country bar ? not exactly ... moonshine is definitely a country bar with a college town twist . they have a great dance floor and most people are doing the two - step and doing it well . makes me wish i learned more as a kid . the bar also has plenty of bar staff to help you get a drink in a timely manner . this is the best place to go just off mill to have a good time . they are also open on the weekend till 3 am . check it out !
 i really like this restaurant ! we have been here a handful of times in the past year and have never had a bad experience . the waiting staff has always been friendly and we usually have top - notch service . i love sitting outside near the fireplace when the weather is nice ... great atmosphere ! i really enjoy the burgers and the chicken and dumpling soup . yummy ! and although i ' ve never saved enough room for dessert , i have seen the awesome cookie skillet and heard it is delicious ! i ' ll have to remember to go there one day just for the cookie skillet . :)
 why is it so hard to find good thai food ! grrrrr . first timer and new to area . had the tom yum soup which was just ok . would not order again . for the meal , ordered the drunken noodle . the noodles where not the good fat noodles ... but the thin ones . that stinks . very mild flavor and spice . try a different dish . i ' m not sure if this restaurant just caters to the american palate but they need more flavor . 
over priced for the quality they serve . maybe cuz there ' s nothing good around this area people come here . nothing is authentic . their teriyaki sauce is so weird tasting . their rice is over vinegar ' d . my tongue is still stinging after drinking a whole glass of coke . thumbs down !
i ' ve been wanting to try this place for a long time , but i kept missing their business hours . they extended the hours to 5pm and i made it this time ! the sandwiches are huge and loaded with flavor . the place was very clean inside and the woman who helped me order was very sweet and informative . i think i found my new sandwich shop ! thank you woods family !
 quite easily the best laser tag place in the valley . and by far the coolest arena . people who work there are totally awesome . not to mention they actually keep the place clean . great for people of all ages . plus they often have specials ... such as family play packages , so big families can afford to play . tag for tots once a week , and then wednesday and friday nights they have all you can play special . super awesome . 
i normally don ' t post unless the place is exceptional and winnie at beyond beauty lashes did an awesome job ! i was in town visiting my sister and we just yelped this place . what a gem ! my lashes are so soft , feminine , and natural looking . they totally make my eyes pop ! i got my lases done 3 weeks ago and they still look so full . i can ' t be more satisfied . i definitely will come back to winnie the next time i visit !
 thank you nick giordono for the sick tattoo ! it was my first .. i ' ve been thinking about it for years . the staff here all awesome , made me feel right at home . afterward nick told me everything i needed to know about taking care of it .. i was so happy with the service , i ' ve already plan on coming back for my second really soon 
this is the worst piada i have been to . they were out of several ingredients and shorted me on the ones they did have . there avocado was way over ripe and there salsa was mush . the servers paid no attention to my order and had to correct them numbers of times . will never be returning here and do not recommend
 yum ! hubs brought home " to go " order . super delish ! lamb , beef and chicken seasoned and cooked perfectly . rice absolutely scrumptious . pita made from scratch . prices are more than reasonable . hubs said fam owned and awesome ! will def order again ! 
i ' ve only eaten appetizers here but they are awesome . huge portions - one app is enough for 1 . 5 meals . appetizer happy hour is the way to go . the drinks are probably good - there ' s a very creative selection - but i ' m not a drinker so i don ' t know for sure . go upstairs if you can - cuts down on noise and cluster .
 we really like this place -- super friendly owner and have never a wait for a table . reasonably priced generous sushi boats that are excellent . i despise mayo and this is the one sushi restaurant where i don ' t have to worry . the house salad dressing is very good and the udon soup bowls are a perfect warmup in winter . the green tea is made with leaves and not tea bags which is a nice change of pace . win .
